# ibkr_api
Note: this requires ibapi module

ibkr api is clunky, therefore making a dummie, readable, open source ibkr api codes

solely rely on ibapi for following utilities:
1. to parse data and ready for data analytics and so on
2. implement algo trading or other usages.

Currently, I’m managing this project solo. My goal is to have more team members and transition the repository to a nonprofit, where volunteers can sustain it. I want to avoid a scenario like ib_insync, where the owner’s passing led to an unmaintained repo.
